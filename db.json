Uncle Rovine. BS is one of the elder gods. Carlos had a vision of. Rovi is my half-brother. he's full oni. he's my half-brother. do i have a child? i don't know. rovi's innate urge is to eat children. carlos: … lupenna a long time ago, lupenna removed the urges, and certain things changed recently, and he doesn't have the same protections up. carlos: the kids deserve it -- isabella: are very tasty. oh, yes, hahaha.\n\nlupenna is flick's godmother. \n\nflick: the gnoll hunters took us in, and they needed help with something.\ncarlos: we saved the princess\nflick: well they were also being bothered by the bog witch, --- or the gnolls could probably help us.\nflick: the grenlich is no doubt a lot stronger than the gnolls, but the gnolls are more well-meaning. but they still need our help\n\nkolmy is trying to change the entire moral system of gnolls\nbrak shortpaw\nflick: mostly i want to see thaz again, because i have a thing for her.\n\nsome gnolls were saved in the oven\nlum and cora were in the refrigerator.\n\nflick: tantegorisch is going to come for me, eventually. this is what i was given to understand by lupenna. the wolf figurine was some kind of radar blocker that rendered me invisible. \nwhen T starts looking, he'll be able to find us\nbut flick goes to get some sleep\n\nwas lupenna a werejackal all along? how did she fall in with all these spirit ogres? is it through VV connection? did they all use to work at Castle Karn\nLupenna is like a hell-hound like her father (and part elf) -- \n\n** jake: it's interesting he wants to resorb you, given that he doesn't know where you've been\n'resorbing me is gonna be so good -- believe me, you want to resorb me'\n\nisabella comes up with pancakes\nto drav and carlos\nlook like you have unfocused eyes\nparos: they are focused from 18-24 inches\nisabella: one at each? paros -- yes, reading 2 books\nisabella: ooh, you'll have to teach me that.\n\nboggshush. such a bogg. BS, you know. 'sometimes it's easier to abbreviate'\n\nriult's spellbook can't be damaged by fire or water, and won't deteriorate with age.\nflick: you can cast in the shower\nbut it has a curse on it now.\n\n'Aquamuck' \n\ncarlos (jake): maybe they can take me to whatever dimension they hang out in (naphula? and gluder?) \n\nDrav: transcription of the Xanthu tablets. covered in black leather; printed on a printing press. at least 200 years ago. describing the ways in which the followers of BS would prostrate themselves, the language the cultists would use, how they would worship, some of the rituals they would use to invoke BS. \nalso: historical text: the present state of the islands in Snaff Bay. touches on how the myths regarding islands greated when top of grey tongue severed; but how before that, the depression made by one of the forms of boggshush and how it was kicked out by the gods working together. but it's always retained that imprint.\n\ni have paros roll for his new sanity stat [10] . attribute. \njake: it's like the carebears movie\nflick: i'm still tripping balls on all those goodberries i ate\nRevelations of Nundocamar. (almost sounds like a jedi but not quite) \njedi terrorist. terrorist group ? \nthree folios that have been bound into one volume. \n\nparos retreats into own mind while reading the text; suddenly it feels [19] roll for feel. \nfelt this before. because he's done training to read people's minds and telepathize with people. usually it's a johnny mnemonic space; but this time he feels paralyzed; drav notices. \njohnnny NO-monic. \ndrav: 15 … perception. paros's breathing becomes very shallow and his eyes close. he has a heartbeat. drav has seen this before as a wizard; if you'd casts a paralyze spell. \n\ncarlos: is that a problem? did the book cast its own spell on paros?\n\nparos hears veenock. 'wonderful to be reacquainted with you.' \nparos derived his power from a demon that he made a magical pact with. ? (sorcerers - special lineage, or sell souls -- that's actually warlock)\nconvort paros from sorcerer to warlock\nveenock and nundocamar competed a long time ago to take over this high elven cleric Valeryl; like beryl, but val. \ncarlos: why do these demons waste themselves on paros?\nparos: it's mutual\nveenock: i'm trapped in here\nparos: maybe my mind is some kind of candy they can't ignore.\n\ndrav wants to get him to wake up. you can see his hands starting to twitch writing 'valeryl' in clumsy elementary school letters.\ndrav runs and gets carlos\nflick has cast 'PFGE' on paros before.\n\nveenock: nundocamar got the elves body to apply some talisman to shield his body from me.\nthe defeat bothered me and still does. \nveenock: 'i want you to get me that ring'\n'one of my metaphysical ears is stuffed up'\n\ndrav comes across the loose manuscript\nflick: 'we got fucking props. this campaign fucking slaps'\n\nthe watermark from Eaton\n** paper store: ahh, just a papyrus outlet!\nmatt: either well to do, or lived in that area\n\ncarlos: has veenock's advice paid off?\nparos: veenock told me to grab the ashes from defeating naphula and gluder\n\nflick: can joan and i spend the day to check out the north tower.\nshe hasn't had as much time for me with her egg to take care of\n\n** remy flitch might come up to us and ask for back-pay; we fought a demon fish that let us breath underwater. you think you're shit, you  low-level rogue. \n\ndrav look through Xanthu tablets to see if there's anything practical\nfind the text of the rituals to invoke a henchman or apparition of boggshush, and by studying the ritual, you could figure out how to stop it; nat 1: so drav thinks she knows how to stop it. \n\nnorth tower is tidy; quaint. smoke coming out of the chimney. \nflick: i knock an arrow and proceed through the portcullis. \ntools for landscaping and masonry; workman shed; hay\n\nflick: 'doing joan: 'what is this, a tower for eggs?!' '\n\nparos: what if someone's casting create smoke?\npeople: looks like things have been recently moved around; pieces of fresh earth; not crusty earth\nflick searches shelves and tools thoroughly.\n(masterwork weapons and amulets)\n17 investigation \nfind a rope of climbing\nwhat attracts my attention? made of silk. fizzlecyst silk. not poisoned. coarse silk. hoist it. 3 pounds. tke it out into light; can i tell anything about its tensile strength. not made of twine. constructed very well, it doesn't fray. test its strength, it holds surprisingly strongly. it's not elastic.

A jagged promontory stabbed upwards out of the otherwise placid web; unmistakably, this was the chasm which that splinter of Sirmgalv carved through the tapestry of ghostly mundanity. Its frantic outline led unerringly south, seeking the great leuqline which unites the islands and makes landfall in Nicklefurrow. Near the north-west elbow of the leuqline the spear's fulgurous spoor sunk precipitously into the ground and out of sight. Confident I could mirror its path, I released myself from the ritual's grasp, but the sere afterimage of that ungodly weapon marched across my vision, and I took slow and uncertain steps south.",

The effect lasts for one munte, after which the orb is ejected from the creature’s preferred orifice. Consuming takes one action. The effect can be ended at any time by using a bonus action.

                    "The band of adventurers, having expelled von Veen's spirit from Uugeet, discovered that their victory coincided fortuitously with the celebration of Raising the Pendulum Bob which simultaned [coincided] that year with Braggot Day in the gnome town of Briangle. Drav customed [visited] the local post office branch to ship a frosty bottle of trollsmilk and an extensive missive to her family in Forest Ogrelodge. Fez, always perfectly in touch with his inner springwork, was motivated to call forth a steadfast steed. Tregetting [juggling] for inspiration a piece of coral bestowed to him under miraculous circumstances, he attracted the attention of a sloppy clown named Kuma who led him to a park pond swarming with cave turtles from which the ecologically irresponsible jape gathered a healthy supply of eggrocks. Meanwhile, Carlos, having glutted his mouth and purse with vendible candies which could have been purloined for free from the Candy Lab, gawked at The Unwieldy Dolphin's shingle and forthnimmed [proceeded, lit. 'go away, go forth'] to a desecrated former shrine to Aulë being used as a social club. He attempted to preach the good word to the finger-sandwich-eating, real-estate-discussing philistines, but, unable to convert any of the nonbelievers, satisfied himself with carving a statuette of Aulë into the rock wall and distributing prayer books with Drav's help. While Paros won himself a manuary [(prob.) pardon] from the local villagers to free the pendulum bob from its hempen restraints and return quasi-time to the town, Flick took a moment to recall sifting some poudree [medicinal powder] from Uugeet's pool before samming up [gathering] the party and making for the surface with Domonkos.",
                    "Achieving externity [(prob.) coming to the surface] on The Grey Tongue, all but Carlos and Flick were taken unawares by two shapeless black muckhumps calling themselves Naphula and Gluðer who, drawn by Drav's demon skinprint, attempted to incaptivate [capture] and dissolve the dwarven wizard. After unceremoniously roasting Gluðer, the party danced around serving up Naphula in the same way until Drav could be safely extracted and Flick, amused by the ooze, could invite Naphula to confederate with them. The super-lemure having been cindered, Paros scooped some ash at the behest of Veenock and then went to get some ass with Domonkos, making it to vampire-second-but-human-third?-base, all the while chaperoned by trigger-low-affect Flick. Rather than spending the night in the woods, everyone vamoosed behind the vampire to the castle, making for the single lit room high in the central palace. The tricky little spellbook Drav snatched from Riult took one last leap at manumission and inconveniently revealed their position, but it seemed to matter not, as who should await them in the bedroom chamber but one calling herself Lupenna; and, as if that were not enough, she recognized Flick!"

                    "While Fez and Flick sunk into a quiet sloom [doze], Carlos, Drav, Paros, and Joan tied up a few loose ends. Carlos helpfully speculated that 'maybe Juniper came from a meat-person that wore the mask, and Juniper laid a meat-egg, and then Juniper was inside the meat-egg.' Further afrayning [questioning] prompted Ethel to pontificate on the 'ancient ways of the Three School' and Juniper's particular interest in the mysteries of life and death. All matters resolved, the gang turned their attentions to ••; Drav determined that the blurry symbols decorating ••'s shell were lexemes in an old language used by artificers, and Paros unintentionally presented the tremulous box with visions of evisceration. Before much else could go wrong, /, a construct isometric to ••, hailed the group and led them to Red Fox University. Passing through a cozy common room inhabited by Briffa and Reginald, two teenful [annoyed; cognate with Old Saxon tiono crime, injustice, injury] students, and a sleepy xorn named Turkey, where they learned that •• had been running away from an emotionally volatile love triangle with – and - (siblings, no less!). Joan smashed down some doors to track the still fleeing / who brought them ultimately to Sik's alchemical workshop, where •• received some much-needed relaxation and reprogramming. After smoking a bit of laced leaf, Sik showed Joan how to turn her multicolored stone into a floating force field and pointed them towards Professor Henriette Erman who, aside from studying for a license to practice psychiatric medicine, schooled them on the ancient mountain deity Karnish and the primordial provenance of the various Three Schools which roam the land. Finally, they were pointed to Ymenestra, a visiting lecturer with a personal and professional interest in depossessions and exorcisms."
