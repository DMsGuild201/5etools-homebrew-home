Any devil's magic performed against the marked creature has advantage due to the mark, including touch spells, innate spell-like or supernatural abilities, and magic drawn from a scroll or other item by a devil. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil."
