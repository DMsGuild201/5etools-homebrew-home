        'You may take a reaction to pull, tug, rub, or otherwise manipulate the earring. For the next minute, all temporary hit points granted to you will “stack” rather than replacing one another. At the end of the minute, you retain any temporary hit points which have not been lost. This ability resets each dawn.',
