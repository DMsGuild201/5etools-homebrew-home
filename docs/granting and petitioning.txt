 When a dialogue scene starts, decide if a conflict is actually warranted. Find the petitioner and granter.
 Find what the petitioner wants—that’s what the scene is about.
 For an NPC petitioner, pick a starting tactic. 10 Robin D. Laws
 
 For an NPC granter, respond to the PC’s starting tactic with a deflecting tactic appropriate to the character and situation.
 Keep trading tactics until:
 The petitioner finds one that works
 End scene with victory for petitioner It becomes clear that no tactic will work
 End scene with loss for petitioner
 As in any RPG scene, both failure and success then lead to a new scene
that moves the story toward a conclusion.
