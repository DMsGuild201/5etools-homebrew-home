Prostrating myself in ritual abnegation, I dove into the seething whirlwind of jukas, the roiling signs left by the unsatisfied spirits who had passed by.

Near the north-west elbow of the leuqline the spear's fulgurous spoor sunk precipitously into the ground and out of sight.

The effect lasts for one munte, after which the orb is ejected from the creature’s preferred orifice. Consuming takes one action. The effect can be ended at any time by using a bonus action. This effect can be used once per day per creature (resetting at dawn). It time a creature uses it in a day beyond that first use, their Constitution drops by 3.

          "The band of adventurers, having expelled von Veen's spirit from Uugeet, discovered that their victory coincided fortuitously with the celebration of Raising the Pendulum Bob which simultaned [coincided] that year with Braggot Day in the gnome town of Briangle. Drav customed [visited] the local post office branch to ship a frosty bottle of trollsmilk and an extensive missive to her family in Forest Ogrelodge. Fez, always perfectly in touch with his inner springwork, was motivated to call forth a steadfast steed. Tregetting [juggling] for inspiration a piece of coral bestowed to him under miraculous circumstances, he attracted the attention of a sloppy clown named Kuma who led him to a park pond swarming with cave turtles from which the ecologically irresponsible jape gathered a healthy supply of eggrocks. Meanwhile, Carlos, having glutted his mouth and purse with vendible candies which could have been purloined for free from the Candy Lab, gawked at The Unwieldy Dolphin's shingle and forthnimmed [proceeded, lit. 'go away, go forth'] to a desecrated former shrine to Aulë being used as a social club. He attempted to preach the good word to the finger-sandwich-eating, real-estate-discussing philistines, but, unable to convert any of the nonbelievers, satisfied himself with carving a statuette of Aulë into the rock wall and distributing prayer books with Drav's help. While Paros won himself a manuary [(prob.) pardon] from the local villagers to free the pendulum bob from its hempen restraints and return quasi-time to the town, Flick took a moment to recall sifting some poudree [medicinal powder] from Uugeet's pool before samming up [gathering] the party and making for the surface with Domonkos.",
          "Achieving externity [(prob.) coming to the surface] on The Grey Tongue, all but Carlos and Flick were taken unawares by two shapeless black muckhumps calling themselves Naphula and Gluðer who, drawn by Drav's demon skinprint, attempted to incaptivate [capture] and dissolve the dwarven wizard. After unceremoniously roasting Gluðer, the party danced around serving up Naphula in the same way until Drav could be safely extracted and Flick, amused by the ooze, could invite Naphula to confederate with them. The super-lemure having been cindered, Paros scooped some ash at the behest of Veenock and then went to get some ass with Domonkos, making it to vampire-second-but-human-third?-base, all the while chaperoned by trigger-low-affect Flick. Rather than spending the night in the woods, everyone vamoosed behind the vampire to the castle, making for the single lit room high in the central palace. The tricky little spellbook Drav snatched from Riult took one last leap at manumission and inconveniently revealed their position, but it seemed to matter not, as who should await them in the bedroom chamber but one calling herself Lupenna; and, as if that were not enough, she recognized Flick!"

          "While Fez and Flick sunk into a quiet sloom [doze], Carlos, Drav, Paros, and Joan tied up a few loose ends. Carlos helpfully speculated that 'maybe Juniper came from a meat-person that wore the mask, and Juniper laid a meat-egg, and then Juniper was inside the meat-egg.' Further afrayning [questioning] prompted Ethel to pontificate on the 'ancient ways of the Three School' and Juniper's particular interest in the mysteries of life and death. All matters resolved, the gang turned their attentions to ••; Drav determined that the blurry symbols decorating ••'s shell were lexemes in an old language used by artificers, and Paros unintentionally presented the tremulous box with visions of evisceration. Before much else could go wrong, /, a construct isometric to ••, hailed the group and led them to Red Fox University. Passing through a cozy common room inhabited by Briffa and Reginald, two teenful [annoyed; cognate with Old Saxon tiono crime, injustice, injury] students, and a sleepy xorn named Turkey, where they learned that •• had been running away from an emotionally volatile love triangle with – and - (siblings, no less!). Joan smashed down some doors to track the still fleeing / who brought them ultimately to Sik's alchemical workshop, where •• received some much-needed relaxation and reprogramming. After smoking a bit of laced leaf, Sik showed Joan how to turn her multicolored stone into a floating force field and pointed them towards Professor Henriette Erman who, aside from studying for a license to practice psychiatric medicine, schooled them on the ancient mountain deity Karnish and the primordial provenance of the various Three Schools which roam the land. Finally, they were pointed to Ymenestra, a visiting lecturer with a personal and professional interest in depossessions and exorcisms."
