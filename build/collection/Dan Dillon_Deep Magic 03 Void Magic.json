One creature of your choice within 10 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against this magic (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.",

The first time you use this ability, you suffer no adverse effects. If you use it again before completing a short or long rest, you take {@damage 1d4} necrotic damage. Each additional time you use it before finishing a rest, the necrotic damage increases by {@dice 1d4}."
