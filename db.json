The floor is covered in an ankle-deep layer of soft dried paper pulp which exudes a cloud of greyish dust when disturbed. He takes hesitant steps towards a whitewashed pedestal on top of which sits a large glass jar containing dry, dark brown soil. Lifting the heavy glass lid from the jar, Gob reaches in a hand and pulls up a clenched fist full of the loose earth. He steels himself momentarily and then gobbles up the dirt, taking vast reckless bites and chewing wildly before swallowing the globus. His clean hand reaches out to grab the edge of the pedestal and steady him, but before he finds support he collapses backwards into the powdery carpeting. ",

      "description": "Hey Angela, thanks for your kind words! As far as getting to use the evocation features a little early, that sounds great. Here's my breakdown: \n\nDon't need to worry about: \n2 (Sculpt Spells): You already have this one, I think? So we don't have to worry about that.\n6 (Potent Cantrip): Everyone will definitely get to level 6 (probably after another 4/5 sessions), so that will roll around too.\n\n## Extra damage spells:\n- __do something with a tattoo on her hands, that let her do spells, so doesn't have to worry about spellbook, but there is a cost ? or something like that.__ \n10 (Empowered evocation): extra damage\n14 (Overchannel): extra damage with a tradeoff\nThese seem like they would fit in with a plan I have for Drav, so I will incorporate them with the narrative over the next few sessions as I'm able.\n\nMore spell slots:\n18 (Spell mastery): You basically get another 1st and 2nd level spell slot.\n20 (Signature spell): You basically get 2 3rd level spell slots.\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is almost like being able to (1) take more rests, and (2) experiment with more spells, both of which I'd like to encourage. How about, every 2 sessions, you get to pick up 1 thingy of those described. (So, this coming session, you get Spell Mastery of a 1st level spell. In two weeks, you get Spell mastery of a 2nd level spell. In 4 weeks, you get Signature spell of a 3rd level spell. In 6 weeks, you get Signature Spell of another 3rd level spell. (Or if that's too fast, we can do every 3 weeks).\nI'm not going to restrict you to picking spells from your spellbook, since you haven't had a chance to build that up yet. So feel free to pick spells from any source available to you. I'd probably suggest picking spells that you think primarily define Drav as a character in addition to making her a more formidable force (intellectually, martially, etc), and maybe attending them with mini backstories, or personal ways in which Drav casts them. \n\nLet me know how that sounds  :)\nZach",

While cursed, if you have a neutral or good alignment, each long rest you must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, suffering from a shortterm madness (p. 259 of the Dungeon Master Manual) on a failed save.

Dalarien could be a race/species/religion/philosophy?\n\nI know there was the symbol/vision of the 7-winged wheel with eyes on it, but I forget what happened in conjunction with that. I assume it was something related to Dalariel, given the style of the imagery and the -ariel ending on Dalariel’s name seeming angelic/celestial.\n\nI’m guessing Veenock and Dalariel are opposing forces of evil and good, perhaps within the context of some religious framework or context. Can Paros try to find out why they even appeared to him in the first place? Would Phoenix Molvraki or the book (forgot the title, but I think I wrote it down) have clues? Maybe Paros can find a copy of that book or a tangentially related historical passage in another book in the library of Castle Carn?\n\nMore supposition and/or take whatever sounds good and/or like it fits with whatever else you planned:\nMaybe they are appearing to Paros because of something that happened in the past. E.g. someone (who was previously close to Paros or that he trusted) made a promise to Veenock (or whoever/whatever Veenock gets his power from—so Veenock is an intermediary?) either behind Paris’s back or with some assent from Paros, to gain personal power, but Paros didn’t realize the depth of evil implied by the agreement, so he turned away from that and now tries to balance it by doing good in the world, and Dalariel recognizes that. Paros listens to both sides of an argument because he’s been on the wrong side in the past and knows it.\n\nMaybe he could also have some amnesia regarding whatever happened with Veenock in the past (before the candy lab incident).  I think Paros really needs to find and talk to Phoenix Molvraki (or disciples thereof?? Would Lupenna or someone else nearby have any knowledge of this).\n\n",

At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.\n> A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.\n\n- i use rules for poisoner's kit\n\n## hunter's kit\n\n- DC 20: able to handle poison without poisoning yourself\n- can determine its effects; to stay on arrowhead and remain potent and not burn into arrowhead, have to let it remain liquid adhesive.\n- hours work with successful survival or nature check.\n- [12] roll; spent hour fruitlessly looking for that substance.\n- goes to find Thaz in Hut of Sadness (bothán brón)\n- Flick: \"I'm not doing enough damage -- with poison\"\n- Thaz: yes, you did quite a bit of damage to my once-dead lover\n- flick: i'm sorry --- that means you're available tho, right\n- Flick: we're hunters, we have fun\n- Thaz: I don't know if re-integrating just now, bringing a foreigner in would be acceptable\n- Flick: yeah, overton window\n- Thaz: mostly use frog and snake poisons; we'll have to be a little more careful with that.\n  - will have to do some experimentation while they are out there.\n- [roll 19]:\n- water postpada: slimy cactus-sap you can combine with the blood; glycerine\n  - took all the 2 hours\n  - will have to mix with blood alchemically\n  - convert 2 litres of 5 litres of blood into poison.\n  - the mixture can seep into the quiver, too\n  - mechanically, how to do this ... compete with planar warrior\n  - Carlos: antipoison (from anti-matter force) might heal somebody!\n\n## fully at the morning\n\n- goodberries go bad; distributed to needy gnolls\n- Carlos wants to examine the fungal wounds -- like a doctor\n  - **Tea tree oil** preparations were tested in four randomized clinical trials and some positive outcomes were attributed to the intervention in all trials. **Solanum species** (Solanine) (two trials) and **oil of bitter orange** preparations (one trial) were compared with conventional treatments.

farm animals\n\n-   carlos: when juniper hatches, will she have her whole personality and memory\n\n-   she'll have an intuitive desire to put on the mask; once that happens, a lot of her drives and memories will be reinjected\n\n-   the mask is attached to joan to ensure the birth of the next juniper;

recently the grey tongue has been the locus of a lot of that activity\n\n-   drav: but that's specific to juniper; \n\n-   they all have different raison d'etre\n\n-   carlos: what's the origin of bad stuff\n\n-   ermann: it's got worse recently, but started since karnish temporary banished by tangegorish (\"quarter of a century ago\"  years ago)\n\n-   we'd like to see karnish reinstated; even under domonkos, karnish was able to thrive. things were terrible under tantegorisch. \n\n-   carlos: we have a theory about the ghost-fish (gauche-fist)\n\n-   carlos: one of tantegorisch's clients, von veen, is inside the fish\n\n-   might be specialty of someone concerning themselves with spirits. i don't have much in the way of magic\n\n-   paros: what is history medicine like then ?\n\n-   \"dr\" of history. ermann: hands you secular ministrations, penned by doodril frogwarts, burghar and sublunar cognoscente. best seller. i think this should interest you quite a lot.\n\n-   paros: medicine used to fix history?\n\n-   what is karnish supposed to look like?\n\n-   show them the spirit troll\n\n-   spirit form, and elemental locus form, when she takes on the power and appearance of earth itself, and looks like an avalanche or a landslide of rocks in perpetual motion. she's only appeared in spirit form since she was banished.\n\n-   \"throwing behaviors\" \n\n-   carlos: can you refer us to another professor? \n\n-   point to Ymenestra -- a visiting lecturer. she's a fate-runner . they effect exorcisms by becoming one with the host and drawing out the evil forces possessing them. even if it's a giant fish. her knowledge may be more practical than academic, but she is lecturing here. \n\n-   ermann gives joan a sweet high-five\n\n-   does ermann toke\n\n-   paros telepathizes\n\n-   plus paros is kind of a paranoid stoner -- is it wired in here? \n\n-   black footed ferrets steal gold. \n\n-   phrase: \"i'll give it the old nickel try\" -- if doing it is worth less than the effort it would take to say \"no\". it's a gnomish expression.\n\n-   to pot\n\n-   \"you should really try this\" -- pulls out a jug of white liquid. it's trolls milk. \n\n-   paros telepathizes with her again. d20 please. \n\n-   she gives them a jug of milk \n\n-   tastes like very good milk. and you're not sure if its this, or something else recent, but you feel like you're super-tough now, like nothing could hurt you.\n\n-   carlos: it's b/c karnish knows were trying to do her will.\n\n-   carlos: \"we all had more than you did!\"\n\n-   homeopathic dosing.\n\n-   \"body by trollmilk\"\n\n-   as you're about to leave, and ermann spots the bracer. paros notices you address her directly. \n\n-   \"this is how you've been telepathizing with me\"\n\n-   \"hi, i'm paros\" -- \"you make such a good student on the first day, introducing yourself\"\n\n-   it will be an overwhelming source of difficulty if you continue\n\n-   the bracers are meant to be used only by those who are devotees of dalariel, or those who are skilled in the ways of the mystics. \n\n-   a mystic we have here, her name is phoenix molvraki, she's from very far away, \n\n-   gives a bracelet -- not only will this make you feel like your arthritis has been cured, but it will suppress the abilities and side effects from the bracer. i'd suggest talking to phoenix. their life has been spent learning about this kind of energy and communication. and i think they can help if you want to persist on this path.\n\n-   for religious followers, the abilities are granted by who they pray to\n\n-   paros can just take bracer off; the bracelet is also phoenix's calling card, since she moves around a lot\n\n-   i wouldn't recommend direct communication yet; it might do permanent damage to you\n\n-   paros: i had a vision of a friend electrocuting other two.\n\n-   i'm going to cover my braces here\n\n-   have you had other signs of psychological intrusion\n\n-   it could have been any of those things. \n\n-   ... erodes the distinction between different elements, which can emerge through the bracer that will manifest in real life in time. the visions are harbingers of what's to come. it's hinting at the possibilities.\n\n-   rolling charisma check\n\n-   when ermann showed the karnish spirit, you have image of a great war  , on one side there are thousands of dragons; on the other side, thousands of giants, some are great wizards, some are mercenaries, and coming to clash in the middle. you feel deep within yourself an ancient hatred for the giants. \n\n-   not sure if karnish was giant or part-giant. \n\n-   not specific hatred towards karnish, it just called this into her mind.",

The druids performed a ritual to extract this power from her, because ultimately she was inclined towards the good, but in order to do so they had to render her unconscious. Aphelia was born during that period as the physical embodiment of the Kiss, and taken from her mother.)\n\nThe attempt to erase this from Calliope's mind backfired, and she was cursed to be a monster that continuously seeks to birth its own children by eating human hearts; her children turn out stillborn because as part of the curse, and she is forced to continue.

Those few who survive the effort do so by sheer luck or by harnessing some rare form of magic that protects them against the hostile atmosphere. They soon discover, however, that they can't leave as easily as they arrived. For each creature that enters the plane, a nightwalker is released to take its place. In order for a trapped creature to escape, the released nightwalker must be lured back to the Negative Plane by offerings of life for it to devour. If the nightwalker is destroyed, the trapped creature has no hope of escape. \n (CR 20)\n\nsomething with VEEN going to negative plane, or Tantegorisch hiding out there; ?\nSee an infinity of knowledge in the Nightwalker\n.wav file\n\na night hunter (“BABA JEZDA”), daughter of Djedkare\nshe is just a window in the world’s wall, to a nebula\nsounds of space attend her like eddies \n“You didn’t quite change your name, my son”\n",

      "description": "Jean-Luc, is a chaotic good rogue.  (He's a character I built for another campaign that I had to abandon and I'd love to resurrect him.) I'm very much a \"personality makes my choices for me\" player: Jean-Luc is a liar and a braggart, he has an overinflated sense of his abilities, a penchant for exaggerating his accomplishment and hardships. As such he is constantly writing checks he can't cash.  He talks frequently about how he was raised on the streets etc etc, but actually his parents were white picket fence middle class people.  He carries around a sword he calls \"Lydia\" after the woman who stabbed him in the heart, (she's also a perfectly nice person and the break-up was amicable).\n\nDespite this he does have a good heart, his targets tend to be rich folk, he's got a soft spot for the downtrodden and oppressed. He's a hopeless romantic who falls in love with every tavern server who smiles at him.  A while back he got in over his head with some bad dudes, he joined a local crime syndicate, lured in by a honey pot. He didn't realize that they didn't share his smash the patriarchy ideals. He ended up having a crisis of conscious and foiled their plot to kidnap a young heiress cause she was five years old and they would have likely killed her anyway, but they realized they had been betrayed and are now looking for him.",

A jagged promontory stabbed upwards out of the otherwise placid web; unmistakably, this was the chasm which that splinter of Sirmgalv carved through the tapestry of ghostly mundanity.

Near the north-west elbow of the leuqline the spear's fulgurous spoor sunk precipitously into the ground and out of sight. Confident I could mirror its path, I released myself from the ritual's grasp, but the sere afterimage of that ungodly weapon marched across my vision, and I took slow and uncertain steps south.",

A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.\n\nYou can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.\n\nThe tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.\n\nSource: MTF, page 167.

Drav customed [visited] the local post office branch to ship a frosty bottle of trollsmilk and an extensive missive to her family in Forest Ogrelodge. Fez, always perfectly in touch with his inner springwork, was motivated to call forth a steadfast steed. Tregetting [juggling] for inspiration a piece of coral bestowed to him under miraculous circumstances, he attracted the attention of a sloppy clown named Kuma who led him to a park pond swarming with cave turtles from which the ecologically irresponsible jape gathered a healthy supply of eggrocks. Meanwhile, Carlos, having glutted his mouth and purse with vendible candies which could have been purloined for free from the Candy Lab, gawked at The Unwieldy Dolphin's shingle and forthnimmed [proceeded, lit. 'go away, go forth'] to a desecrated former shrine to Aulë being used as a social club. He attempted to preach the good word to the finger-sandwich-eating, real-estate-discussing philistines, but, unable to convert any of the nonbelievers, satisfied himself with carving a statuette of Aulë into the rock wall and distributing prayer books with Drav's help. While Paros won himself a manuary [(prob.) pardon] from the local villagers to free the pendulum bob from its hempen restraints and return quasi-time to the town, Flick took a moment to recall sifting some poudree [medicinal powder] from Uugeet's pool before samming up [gathering] the party and making for the surface with Domonkos.\n\nAchieving externity [(prob.) coming to the surface] on The Grey Tongue, all but Carlos and Flick were taken unawares by two shapeless black muckhumps calling themselves Naphula and Gluðer who, drawn by Drav's demon skinprint, attempted to incaptivate [capture] and dissolve the dwarven wizard. After unceremoniously roasting Gluðer, the party danced around serving up Naphula in the same way until Drav could be safely extracted and Flick, amused by the ooze, could invite Naphula to confederate with them. The super-lemure having been cindered, Paros scooped some ash at the behest of Veenock and then went to get some ass with Domonkos, making it to vampire-second-but-human-third?-base, all the while chaperoned by trigger-low-affect Flick. Rather than spending the night in the woods, everyone vamoosed behind the vampire to the castle, making for the single lit room high in the central palace. The tricky little spellbook Drav snatched from Riult took one last leap at manumission and inconveniently revealed their position, but it seemed to matter not, as who should await them in the bedroom chamber but one calling herself Lupenna; and, as if that were not enough, she recognized Flick!",

Remy’s thaumaturge Snav, after inspecting the artifact, grotesquely directed her to one ‘Lupenna’ near the town of Marshbout. Remy, though annoyed by Flick’s importunity, dispatched Joan — travelling to Marshbout on her own assignment — as a chaperone.\n\nThey both made their way south without issue until their passage over a stone bridge was impeded by a deceptively adorable bearcublike creature sporting a single spiral horn on its forehead. Joan’s attempts to platonically embrace the creature were misinterpreted as aggression, and she allowed herself to be flung to the side so as to spare it any embarrassment. Flick, evincing her trademark uncircumspect insistency, presented the creature with her onyx figurine. The Zorbo, upon touching the object, began to take on its material attributes (for such, as they surmised, is the way of Zorbon), only to be afflicted by something far more powerful, and collapsed. They administered to the cub as best they were able, but only time and physical contact with its fieldstone home could help the cutie, so they proceeded apace to Marshbout.\n\nMeanwhile, Drav, a dwarf wizard raised by elves in Forest Ogrelodge, adventured westward to discover kindred dwarven communities. At the foothills of the Steeple Peak Mountains, she was introduced to Carlos the Dwarf, a cleric about to travel to Marshbout to donate his healing expertise to the beleaguered community there.\n\nThey were offered a ride by the stormless cloud giant Rufus Skyflume. After a day in his makeshift wagon surrounded by longhaired cloud cattle and a shorthaired favorite named Priscilla, they parted ways at Balach Pass when Rufus headed north to visit a family member. What should have been a half-a-day’s march to town elongated somewhat when they passed by Mirror Lake, whose strange magic required that they swap some possessions before escaping its spatio-temporal loop. They arrived in Marshbout later that afternoon, and, while making their way to the Perch Office to send messenger owls with letters of safe arrival to their families, Drav sighted an enormous cat. When they inquired of the loquacious Perchmaster General as to any events or conditions requiring clerical ministration, he mentioned a few instances of exploding bodies and zombified cats, but could not comment as to the ‘pig-sized’ feline of Drav’s report. He was able to point them towards Norman Barrelchest, one of the town’s constables (in charge of the armamentarium and responsible for ensuring the safety of the nearby highways).",

They were about to meet-cute Drav and Carlos at the entranceway when an agitated and aggrieved band of five humans pushed their way past and into the building. Carlos stood by disinterestedly (almost as though he were an entirely different person than earlier that day) while the contact he had been sent to talk to, Norman Barrelchest (one of the armory’s constables) attempted to impress upon this furious group his social superiority through enigmatic gesticulations and the distinct absence of suspenders (traditionally associated, in Marshbout, with the gentry). He was nevertheless pulled in their wake back up Plumb Highway (so called because of how straight it is, aka SCBOHSIT or “skee boh sit”) to the scene of some annoyance. Carlos dolly-zoomed in on a medical supply cabinet at the end of the infirmary as his kleptomania took hold. After some hijinks, Joan was able to thrust herself in the mix and come up with some much-vaunted suppositories and also a minor potion of healing (2d4+4 hp, 1 action), which she delivered forthwith to Carlos.\n\nFlick, too, took full advantage of this opportunity to secure the attention of Darlyle (looking a bit overworked) and Rik Sandstone (looking a bit overdressed), the two medics. They were able to do what Carlos, in his infinite sadness, had been unable to accomplish; -- namely, point Flick to Lupenna’s likely whereabouts in the visinage of Castle Karn on the Grey Tongue. Flick was not slow to point out Carlos’s relative inadequacy, thus igniting the powerful cleric’s deep-seated rage and commencing what would surely become one of the great rivalries the continent, nay, the world! had ever known.\n\nDespite this newly minted drama, the four began the five-mile trek to the Tongue. With confidence at its peak, they were enjoying the plush tranquility of Thubutter Farest when they were set upon by three plant-dogs affected by an inky evil seeping out of their eye sockets. The dogs, begging to be 'weeded', 'lawn'ched themselves at the travellers. Though the dogs were handily dispatched (all of whom exploded into clouds of ash upon death), Carlos was injured and laid flat during the fight. He was taken by a brief fit during which he suffered an ominous vision of a tunnel deep within the earth and a shapeless void moving towards him. However, perceiving that Carlos was not dead, Flick loudly boasted about her martial superiority, and the adventurers considered their options.",

They demurred slightly when considering the arrangement in retrospect, but Isabella remained convinced that she couldn't have tended the castle in her true form without causing terror amongst the townsfolk. Flick retired rather than adumbrate a detailed genealogy with her godmother and half-aunt, and the gang awoke the next morning to delicious stacked pancakes and an invitation to assist Isabella with research into Boggshosh, the elder god. Drav and Paros, delighted by the offer, perused old tomes with Carlos at the ready in case of overexertion. Drav, ever in command of her faculties, discovered texts on the ancient rituals of Boggshuosh cultists and a loose leaf from a memoir concerning Sirmgalv, a quasi-mythological world-tree. Paros, lost in contemplation, was Veenock'ed around and put in mind of a primeval rivalry between the evil spirit and the demon Nundocamar; he was further tasked with the recovery of an onyx ring with great psionic powers.\n\nFlick and Joan, meanwhile, took advantage of the crisp fall air and trekked to the North Tower, which they discovered to be more of a waystation for happenstansical travelers. Flick immediately ransacked the workshed and pilfered a pair of sealskin gloves and an unexpectedly strong rope woven out of fizzlecyst silk. Joan, convinced the tower housed eggs in need of protection, attempted to open the door from the downside up, and in so doing alerted the resident, Hale Clotwool, who introduced herself as a herder. Greeted also by the music inside (_Straight out the butte: never gonna' plateau_, by The Young Fustics), the smells of a rich second breakfast, and the inquisitive head of a laid-up turr named Orbell Daedonbashur, Joan and Flick assisted in repairing the door and casing the joint. Flick's heightened conusance of portalian japery, however, shattered the placid free-for-all and brought her face to face with an avatar of Juniper Three School; together they inferred that the reddish-gold ingots were somehow altering the planar coherence around Egg Three School.\n\nBy early afternoon everyone had reconvened at Castle Karn, just in time to witness an efflorescent belch of petals aflame exploding from Tobolux's berninde. It took Paros's increasingly worrisome familiarity with Veenock to make an assay at the truth: demonic BaphOMO got sloppy attempting to influence the current cosmological detente on Thuslubber[^thuslubber] and killed some 'weak and tasty' _bloemenwet_. Domonkos and Lupenna, unbothered by the general goings-on, began to draft up the details for an immortal castle timeshare, and the group headed towards _An Sráidbhaile_. It quickly became necessary to implement 'ghost fog protocol,' involving, in part, mental exercises to prevent subconscious resentment of people considered mediocre; but, even perceptive Flick was taken unawares upon stumbling into Grenlich's immor. As Joan rushed forward to embrace the future of humanoid-manity, the other adventurers did what they could to injure the poor unfortunate gnoll, in pain, in need.\n\n## Début\n\n[^thuslubber]: The isthmus which encloses Snaff Bay west of Marshbout.",

Meanwhile, Curculio approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend Wodden just after he escaped the confines of a magic lake. Curculio believed that playful flowerfolk were known to swarm to the lake's bittersweet magic and, if seen, could serve as guides. Paros worried that Baphomet posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez unhelpfully misheard Baphomet as \"Bear Vomit.\"\n\nParos went on to insult human-fox news in front of Curculio, and admitted that sourced his own news from the psychic manifestation of an evil entity known as Veenock. Curculio mentioned another friend of hers, Zadee (a competent [^_verb runt_], which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous 63-letter alphabet employed by many canids.\n\nCurculio, took a moment to size up Turtle's gastronomical potential, proceeding to describe her home cuisine of [^_schilpad stoofpot_]. Fez declared himself \"His Seaness\" -- a necessary ego boost before the kitsune maligned a halfling language orthography for consisting of only \"bowls and sticks.\" Fez was put in mind of Doodril Frogwart's _Bowls and Sticks: a Confusing language for a Charming people; an Abecedarium or alphabetical Primer_ published through Doodle's Toodles, an \"young readers\" imprint of Frogwart's primary publisher. Curculio mentioned Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic in Marshbout, the not-unsuspicious vanguard of a series of similar clinics popping up in the major cities, and the primary distributor of the _Secular Ministrations_, a copy of which Paros lifted from the Castle Karn library. Drav was able to confirm that Frogwart was not only prolific, but prolithic, as he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals. Paros unsuccessfully attempted to recall the method for extracting malt sugar (maltose) from barley, disappearing into one of his familiar reveries and dreaming about the fancypencils he used at the castle. Out of nowhere, Fez, determined to save the face of his people, declared that \"in our world, flowers are the children's money.\"\n\n#### The ghost in the woods\n\nContinuing south through the forest, the group came across an innocuous ghost trapped in what appeared to be an ghostly, evolving maze. When Fez approached, he was recognized by the spirit, which resolved into the likeness of of Cpt. Merrigold. Juna revealed that the death of Von Veen released her from her piscine hybrid form; however, before she could arrive at the ultimate destination on her postmortem journey, she was redirected into the limitless maze in which she now found herself. With Baphomet's influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet, allowing one to encase people or spirits in demiplanar mazes, might be siphoning life energy from Juna.\n\nAs Fez retreated into the [^_seomra crann_] to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav notioned using Turtle as merely a catalyst and seasoning for a \"turtle bath stew.\" Informing Fez of this upon his return, the overconfident halfling opined on the fox fur stew so favored by halfling-kind. Curculio slashed Fez across the face for this insult, interjecting that her mother had died in the Foxpelt Wars, but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words \"hasty\" and \"tasty\" before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was \"an hour and 50 miles.\"\n\n### Tusternoof\n\nAt that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn open as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as \"Tusternoof\" or \"The twisted one,\" it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian land husbandry, The twisted one provided a possible clue to locating the mirror lake. Paros, realizing the unmined potential of Tusternoof's knowledge, sank deep into its mind as Fez found himself sucked into a mindmaze. Tusternoof unwittingly revealed the 'org chart' of Baphomet's followers (of which he confirmed himself a boon'd lieutenant), including a shadowy cult of [^_urush mekh_] handling intricate metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy.\n\nFez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Drav and Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with well-placed blobs of pure elemental energy.\n\n#### Flowerfolk\n\nWith the monster dead, the forest sprang to life, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk (or _bloemenwet_) in a nearby tree. The creature, named Ashtai, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk. Using Ashtai as a signal booster, Paros harness his bracer to telepathically premonish the bloemenwet on the Slubber, receiving in return nothing but visions of holocaust. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading the minutes of a colloquendo conducted by dwarven geomancers: they had discussed an ancient earth spirit, Mogesh, which was reputed to guard and protect the Slubber. Drav suggested that perhaps Mogesh could be convinced to extend its aegis to the bloemenwet.\n\nThe group pondered what step to take next.\n\n[^verb runt] stenographer; amanuensis; scribe\n[^_seomra crann_](pr 'show-mrah crown'): bathroom; lit. \"tree room\" in halfling\n[^_schilpad stoofpot_] turtle-and-rosepetal stew made customarily from auroch-bladder-sized turtles found in seaside collections of nearly frictionless stones sliding back and forth with the tide along thin trenches\n[^_urush mekh_] whatever dang creature Tusternoof is",

Exuviae admitted that she enjoyed being a member of the bourgeois-leisure class insofar as she was able to provide a similar service _gratis_ to interested members of the burgher demographic. She then turned a scatological imprecation into a confession, revealing that the ring of realistic genital molds kept her trapped in this ring. Carlos attempted to sell out Jean-Luc's jewels (or their negative image), before agreeing with Flick's idea to destroy the integrity of the procreant[^procreant] ring, a task to which they committed themselves once assured of Scrobs's neutrality by the wacky equine. Scrobs, despite the detente, remained a chip off the old block, and danced around the wood elf provocatively in hopes of eliciting a wrestling match.\n\n## smash and stab\n\nDrav, cautious of the possibly toxic genital dust pluming from Carlos's maddened swings, drew into herself, and recalled learning that rituals with similar terrestrial geometry, in the absence of a transcendental power, typically conjured their objects in pairs according to the most powerful axis of polarization: in this case, good and evil (or so she thought). Paros, spaced out for reasons altogether unrelated to his proximal physical environment recalled an ecological text which contended that the natural products of certain ancient worms had the tendency to appear differently to surface dwellers. Drav's suspicions aroused, she began further examining the rocks, and quickly determined that the igneous layer was a mere shell over a viscous brown substance.\n\nAs Flick went to inform everyone of the 'planar anomalies' caused by boggle teleportations, the image of Daealla appeared to her through a Scrobs puddle and enjoined Flick to cease destroying the protective genital ring. As Flick remained unable to tear Daealla from the mirror world for a tete-a-tete, and Drav considered the implications of ancient earth-moving entities, Fez noticed that Exuviae had become transfixed by Daealla's genitals, transformed into a shining vector of pure radiant light visible in the nearest puddle.\n\nStuck in this stalemate, Daealla confessed that the peryton raiding the gnolls had once been a fey succubus named Calliope, whose draining Kiss had been extracted into a literal and symbolic daughter named Aphelia to reduce the number of enucleated men pledging themselves to the ancient horrors. Attending to the matters at hand, the gang took a moment to catch their collective breath and then precipitously lit all the collected genitals on fire in one of the oil pits, occasioning the transformation of one of the larger rock benches into the malicious form of Gedhtathgon, a totally metal black knight, at whose beck and call Exuviae transformed into Hengest the Violent, the Neightmare of renown.\n\n[^thriste]: Bold, daring; audacious, presumptuous.\n[^procreant]: Of, relating to, or enabling procreation.",

The party’s attempts to retrieve the object of interest were thwarted until an exhibition of brute strength by Joan revealed that one of the six classical simple machines (screw threads, which, arguably, are an inclined plane (another simple machine) wrapped around a cylinder) were affixing the pole in the ground. Joan, like a luminous scaly wrench, screwed the pole into the ground until she could retrieve the black metallic sphere which lay in a divot at the top, promptly stuffing it into her backpack — itself still dripping with Dravita’s white ichor.\n\nAs the party continued on their arrow-straight path towards Castle Karn, they heard the active sounds of a village ahead. Flick espied two armed witherlings headed aggressively towards the stead. Moving as quietly as a porcupine in outer space, our intrepid wood elf dismantled one of the creatures with two well-placed arrows and reported back to the party as the other witherling fled. Now on high alert, Flick, Carlos, and Joan approached what they believed to be the sounds of the village, only to discover that the noises were emanating from a grotesque incel-informed parody of a cervid, replete with neckbeard, a propensity for vacuous mimicry, and razor-sharp bone ridges substituting for teeth. Already engaged in battle against the creature were two witherlings and a human sorcerer, Paros. With such concentrated firepower, the monster was soon reduced to a slubbering puddle of flesh, and the witherlings (now, it was clear, a more morally sophisticated group than had been originally assumed) pointed the gang towards the purportedly hospitable and welcoming pale of the gnoll village.",

This latter approach proved its merit, when Thaz, a stealthy outposted guard, got the drop on Flick's hedge-creeping. The magician Mezlar brokered systatic [commendatory] introductions of not only the gnolls but a greedy pig named Gribble which Carlos believed to be out of Paros's romantic league. After Thaz impressed them with hearty calisthenics, Mezlar offered as bivouac the empty home of a recently deceased community member. Flick, ever the detective, described the \"fetus mushrooms\" seen earlier that day to Mezlar, who instantly recognized the object detailed. One of the gnolls, Kolmy Shortpaw, had, a few months ago, moved north of the village near an expanse of desecrated ruins, and renamed herself Grenlich. The gnolls had been rooting out and burning the hodmandods[^hodmandod], but a report of them so far from the village was worrisome; such expansion indicated that Grenlich, once trained by Mezlar's father in techniques now forsworn by the village, could become a sore threat soon.\n\nMining Mezlar further for renseignements, the group learned that Joan's black orb could instantly impart a year's worth of solid core training to one employing its power, and that the material substance of Flick's figuring bore similarities to an onyx-like stone quondam [formerly] mined nearby. At this point, Joan ceremoniously burned Dravita in the town bonfire, and everyone, exhausted by recent travails, betook themself of a nocturnal rest. \n\nThe next morning, Flick abraided [awoke] to the cool 'magical cleansing' tongue of 'Jasper and the Lady Violet' (an intelligent  horse) and its porcine friend. Trivialities were soon shoved aside, though, as a gnoll trapper was carried into town having had his heart torn out and a bevy of winged hodmandods flew into the village, petrified most of the congregated with horrendous shriek, and made to extract the life-force from the dead trapper. A misplaced lightning bolt from Joan allowed one of the creatures to bud a landbound form, and in the fight at least one gnoll was splashed with a sticky ichor before the monsters could take flight. Hoping to provide aid, the adventurers met with Brak Shortpaw, sister to Komy and resident Lorekeeper, who revealed that the trapper's heart had been removed by a not unfamiliar harpy-like creature, and that the appearance of the hodmandods likely an unfortunate coincidence. Apprised of these new developments, the gang took a moment to regroup and steel themselves for their next step.\n\n[^hodmandod]: A generic term for a strange creature which the gnolls used to describe the 'fetus mushrooms.'",

      "session_recap": "Eager to assemble the full might of their peers, Joan and Flick returned to Marshbout to extricate Drav from her goetic studies and bring her to the field once again. They were companioned by one Lum Gorbelly, an untidy gnoll wearing a white skullcap which party obscured a large scar traversing his face. Flick confessed to a small crush on Thaz, which Lum, a moody fellow, ignored graciously. Travel to Marshbout was short and uninterrupted, except by occasional refrications and anxieties of the parasitic nature of Thubudder Farrest. Just as Joan betrayed a worrisome inclination towards fulgurous snorts, fueled by Flick's relentless hot air, the two passed through the stout walls of Famasta Monastery, into its homey cobblestoned courtyard, and took a moment to admire the heavy slate roof and cracked grotesques weighing down the sobor (main monastic building) and set off nicely by the creamy stucco walls and stained glass windows. After perusing a plaque detailing the invention of the metum apmetum (roughly: magic stucco) which was required to stand up to Marshbout's humid climate, and an artistically unsuccessful, if technically impressive, fresco painted by Laeffarelle Floȝed the Fleam and depicting two (perhaps allegorical) philosophers of indeterminate identity, Flick and Joan proceeded to the scriptorium and library. There finding Drav, buried in books but sanguine to continue her worldly adventures, Flick attempted to purloin one of the Doodril Library's tomes put instead was handed a package of missionary pamphlets which Joan stuffed in Drav's haversack.\n\nThe three amigos returned post haste to An Sráidbhaile, but were interrupted en route by the domain of Thuridan, a firbolg who had escaped from the fey wild in order to provide a sanctuary for trollkin. Thuridan divulged that his tiny kingdom had, as of late, been the recipient of certain unwanted intrusions by short-lived 'grotesque canine' forms; the grumic (clotted) puddles into which the monsters collapsed were noxious, avoided by the trollkin, and had to be burned. Ultimately this proved of far less interest than Thuridan's past, of which it became known that he was over one-thousand years old and still suffering from scars and trauma inflicted on him as a youth during cultural rites of passage. He mentioned a group of druids living north in the forest who might know more about the doglike monsters, asked the group to look out for a ggouyl (ghoul) friend of his named Bathybius who had last been seen in the west marshes, and handed Drav a burvība (leaf containing the text of a spell). \n\nThuridan's _uspusta lieta_ [^uspusta] conveniently disgorged the trio near the gnoll village, where Flick soon admitted that the trail of the hodmandods had gone cold;— unlike, however, Carlos's infatuation with a 'gnoll princess' whom he suspected had been captured with ill-intent by gnomes or dwarves. Aiming to impress, Carlos donated his healing prowess to the gnolls still convalescing from that morning's attack. To his dismay, it became clear that whatever power hurt the gnolls would require more profound intervention. Ready to move on, but soured on and suspicious of the quest to locate Lupenna, Flick nevertheless led the group northeast, towards the Grey Tongue and Castle Karn, where the gentlest path led up to an abbey surrounded by hundreds of close-set wooden crosses set in the hardscrabble ground. Entering the refectory, Joan discovered a skitting homunculus whispering \"... they want …\" into her mind, and the brave adventurers pushed their way further into the space.\n\n[^uspusta]: Magic traveling bubble.",

Turns out, before his imprisonment he knew of Lupenna and her father Raul, an izpakla and client of Tantegorische. Carlos, fed up with the ambivalent results of mortal communication, tried to crank up the Aulë-ditory volume by incautiously swinging his hammer around his well-bearded pate. Unfortunately for Carlos, his chosen deity was equally bifarious and returned the call with \"weal and woe.\" Ever the helpmeet, Domonkos took that moment to point out overhead a creature he called Mogh — a cavern-sized manifestation of the cephalopodous creatures so recently dispatched — until that moment, and doubtless by an ineffable cavernly magic, undetected. Irritated at being taken unawares, Flick loosed an arrow, and the fight was on. Mogh thoroughly walloped everyone with falling rocks and her thick black pseudopods, but ultimately the gang triumphed. Fez's unbelievable luck allowed him to escape the brunt of the creature's body as it collapsed off the ceiling, and everyone tended to their wounds. With vampires about, though, the dead are never truly dead, and within moments a shade in the form of Domonkos had arisen from Mogh's corpse and made its way towards the platform on which the vampire remained tied. Anxious for some action, Joan grabbed a leg of the chair supporting Domonkos and pulled him onto the ground, whereupon the vampire, released from his bonds, crushed Ecks, the homunculus, and inhaled the aerosolized dust and the plasmic ghost. In that moment he put on like a coat his ancient power and declared his intent to make haste to Castle Karn. The woozy Kulgmark dwarves troddled back to their deepsome kingdom, and Domonkos roused a dormant glyph on an obscured portion of the back wall, opening up a secret tunnel. Suddenly die-curious, Paros sent the indagatory eddies of his sensoriolum wafting towards the immortal lord, but momently recognized Domonkos as his true friend and ally. Faced with this new quandary, Flick did what she could to erect some barriers against the further psychic intrusions of the vampire, while, in the rear of the entrain, Carlos found himself at the business end of a vengeful sap dæmon.\n\n[^sospitators]: Saviours, rescuers.",

Simultaneously, a nighthunter named Baba Jezda, having been roused by the breaking of the seals restraining Domonkos, manifested in the tunnel and fought the vampire; during the fight, a wild blow collapsed one of the walls, opening up a passage to a parallel tunnel in which flowed a slow back stream. Flick, shaking off a brief fantasy of running free, fast, and undetected forever, inquired of the two titans whatever was amiss between them. Consequently, she may have been the first to witness Mogh’s unexpected emergence from Domonkos’s back. The party split their attention between Zarachiel and the squiddybacking Mogh, and were soon joined by a quartet of gnomes led by one Polive Pittlans, a confectiergamist collecting some of the sweetest sap she’d ever tasted tongue-wise. In a move as characteristic as it was unexpected, Carlos mended the wounded wood and with Polive’s blessing returned Zarachiel whence she came. To help with the party’s other front, Polive offered to retrieve a blue dragon wyrmling named Nexnag that she and the other gnomes had nursed from egghood. Domonkos rendered Nexnag superfluous after banishing Baba Jezda, but not before the nighthunter barricaded the way forward by creating a rock wall and marking it with an arcane rune. A lively discussion ensued between the gnomes, the party, and Domonkos as all decided where to head next, during which colloquy Polive offered Joan a cool bit of body mod for her nesethirls, Rihhilt praised Carlos’s pacific tactics, Foldulf healed Wu’un without magic and scrutinized Fez’s administrations, and Paros foresaw an evil end in Nexnag’s future.",

While Paros futzed about with a draconic alarm clock, the wood elf deferred her doze upon detecting some curious odors emanating from the hob. Polive walked Joan to a worktable in the back where she fitted the adventuresome dragonborn with the promised prototype of \"septum gear,\" a twin of the one seen in situ on Nexnag resembling a boiler's pressure release valve and provided brief instruction in its use and maintenance.

The two besties then made haste to Red Fox University, where they joined the rest of the gang just before entering the redlight laboratory of visiting professor Ymenestra, an elf with shocking white hair, a wispy beard, her body enshrouded by a plaiting of rugged and durable leather straps. After some discussion it was determined that, during the attempt to kill the Baron and prevent him from inhabiting Nexnag's body, Ymenestra would apply her Vorsrunderheirer [fate runner] training and trap von Veen in a time-loop at the moment of Uugeet's death. She delivered unto Flick a crocheted bag of extradimensional capacity [a bag of holding] and in return snatched a bit of grape jerky which she proceeded to shred and use as dental floss. •• returned briefly at the mention of umlauts, and Flick provided to Lanharethquinsathal a flask of fizzlecyst blood and detailed instructions regarding the production of fizzlemeth from such liquid in the hopes of converting a budding classist into a dependent junkie.\n\nThe party returned to Uugeet's Lair where, while exchanging ribaldries with a thin-skinned Domonkos, they discovered the lakebed already drained and slick with a greasy klarshten algae which made treacherous going. Never one to shy from a fight, Joan made haste to bury Junipegg (Ethel titivating [improving the condition of] the resultant mound) and slimeslid her way to the nearest pool — one of two, each containing an identical image of a pallid ghostfish, telltale jagged ochre markings decorating the sides. Flick's unerring feel for the monstrous told her that the ichthyoid Joan was headed for was a phantasm, but too late! as the courageous dragonborn was flung into the water by a prehensile aqueous pseudopod. As the Baron siphoned her life energy, a selshamurrin [selkie] emerged from the water, halsed [called upon] the might of her goddess, and swealed [burned] Domonkos within a pillar of lunar light. Carlos kept Joan alive while Flick, Paros, and Drav aggrieved the great piscine beast and Fez tumbled ablely toward the fray. At long last, von Veen, doubtless feeling the inevitable departure of his power, played one final gambit, and injected falseries, simulations, and tricks [illusions] into the susceptive minds of Flick and Joan. It was too little too late, however, and Ymenestra, bolstered by divine and arcane donations, trapped the Baron in a circlet of time at the moment of Uugeet's death. As a violent concussive wave exploded outwards from Ymenestra, the selshamurrin, bereft of the animating impulse of von Veen, swooned; simultaneously, Fez, dauntless, dove soundlessly to Uugeet's unconscious form, but found himself once again transported before the ancient, primordial guardian of the seas, with a message to protect the light, and seek out Ulimara.",
