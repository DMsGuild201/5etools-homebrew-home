When held in the hand it changes size to fit comfortably in the palm. If you attempt to consume the orb, it shrinks to the size of a small berry relative to your size. After consumption, your speed drops to 1, you cannot become prone, and you have +5 to any Acrobatics checks made. The effect lasts for one munte, after which the orb is ejected from the creature’s preferred orifice. Consuming takes one action. The effect can be ended at any time by using a bonus action. This effect can be used once per day per creature (resetting at dawn). It time a creature uses it in a day beyond that first use, their Constitution drops by 3. Constitution points lost in this way cannot be healed with magic and are regained at the next dawn.",
