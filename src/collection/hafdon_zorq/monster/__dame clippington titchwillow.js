/**
 * DAME CLIPPINGTON TITCHWILLOW: (she, her, hers) Fez foil, a chaotic good rogue , raised by halflings after her drow parents helped an inferior drow family and were murdered. would do much eviller stuff, but this is the midpoint between halflings and drow. 
clothes: bright, ill-fitting halfling clothes. hand-me-down baby-blue sleeveless thigh-length coat over an easter-yellow shirt, grey trousers, all under a thin oilcloth coat the color of stale sage.
of the Wormbranch Titchwillows (three towns east of Cressida)
why is she here? to … assassinate … someone (really a cover for … ?)
