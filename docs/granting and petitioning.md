# granting and petitioning

- When a dialogue scene starts, decide if a conflict is actually warranted. Find the petitioner and granter.

- Find what the petitioner wants—that’s what the scene is about.
  For an NPC petitioner, pick a starting tactic.

- For an NPC granter, respond to the PC’s starting tactic with a deflecting tactic appropriate to the character and situation.
  Keep trading tactics until:

  1. The petitioner finds one that works: End scene with victory for petitioner
  1. It becomes clear that no tactic will work: End scene with loss for petitioner

- As in any RPG scene, both failure and success then lead to a new scene that moves the story toward a conclusion.
